grocery items .Every organization whether small retail store or a big supermarket has
challenges to manage information of customer, grocery products this leads to lot of
manual work. Apart from this customer faces lot of problems for finding some grocery

Therefore, there is a need to make a online grocery system. We will be creating a
system where customer can easily buy the grocery products from home through
internet. This system will reduce lot of manual work for customer as well as owner.
This system also helps the management to reduce the paper work and see any
information they want with just a click because of its smooth UI designed to reduce our
work.
